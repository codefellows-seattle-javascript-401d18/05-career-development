# Custom Methods for object lists
[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

## Project Description
Using vanilla Javascript I wrote custom methods to be used with an list Object Constructor that we built in class. These new methods serve as the traditional push, pop, map, filter, reduce, and slice methods.

### Methods:
+ new List();

+ push(value);
  + Adds user input to the end of object list.

  + Removes last item from user selected list.
+ map(callback);
  + Executes user selected function on every item in user chosen list.
+ slice(arg1, arg2);
  + Removes user's choice of items from a list.
  + arg1 = Start of removal.
  + arg2 = How many to remove from Start.
+ reduce(acc, curr);
  + Will use user supplied function to reduce the number of items in list until there is only one.

These methods are completely free to be used however you'd like!
