## Lab Description
**Lab 5** included a UI Challenge and some data structure challenges.

## Data Structure Challenges/Methods
+ **Instructions:** Create a List constructor that is a replacement for Arrays
Add push, pop, map, filter, reduce, and slice methods to the constructor.
+ See lib/fp.js for methods
+ I tried to write tests but honestly I have no idea where the callbacks for anything that uses callbacks are supposed to go. So do any of these methods work???

## UI Challenge
