#### DATA STRUCTURE CHALLENGE:
* Completed create a List constructor that is a replacement for Arrays
* Added `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `slice` methods to the constructor

#### Docs:
* This lab was to gain a better understanding of how the functions we use on a daily basis on arrays operate. We then rebuild each method and applied it to the List constructor. This was a great insight and deep dive into what's happening under the hood of each of the following methods: `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `slice`. This lab also prepared us for the the following weeks linked list(singly) data structure.

#### Test:
* Tested the list constructor and all of its methods.

#### Questions:
* What did you learn?
  - I gained a better understand of how each of the methods of this lab works. I also gained a bit of gratitude for the methods that we use daily as they make things really easy.

* What challenges did you have?
  - I really struggled with test and realize that I will have to spend quite a bit of time working on testing. It has been frustrating because it highlights what I don't know. However, it has been awesome because if gain a great tool in helping direct me and helping me gain a better understanding of the problem domain.

* What areas of white-boarding do you feel strong at?
  - I feel strong in my ability to communicate through my though processes as I work through a white-boarding challenge.

* What areas of white-boarding do you feel weak at?
  - I've noticed a lack of confidence in my knowledge base of the material and what direction to proceed in. I think this will self correct given experience.
